The AI engineer iteratively developed the NextChapter dating application, demonstrating expertise across full-stack components. Initial work focused on backend API enhancements (FastAPI, MongoDB) and a comprehensive frontend UI/UX overhaul (React, Tailwind CSS) for features like email OTP, profile management, and subscription tiers. A key challenge involved debugging JSX syntax corruption. The engineer then implemented complex business logic, including dynamic pricing for Malawi and diaspora, time-based discounts (Wednesday, Saturday), and geographical matching rules. Recent efforts concentrated on integrating the Paychangu payment gateway, which involved significant debugging of API endpoints, response handling, and webhook idempotency. The engineer also implemented password recovery via OTP and enhanced user feedback through dashboard notifications. The trajectory showcases a systematic approach to addressing user feedback and resolving technical issues, constantly testing and refining the application's core functionality.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with implementing a timeout sequence for failed payments. This involves displaying a timer for 3 minutes and 30 seconds, and then showing an error message if the payment fails due to timeout or the selected payment mode. The last messages indicate that the application's core payment processing (Paychangu integration, redirection, subscription plan display on dashboard) is working correctly, as confirmed by both backend and frontend testing. The user's request for a timeout sequence is the next feature to be added on top of the existing, functional payment flow. This implies adding a client-side timer in the frontend during the payment initiation phase and potentially a backend mechanism to track pending transactions or handle long-polling for payment status with a timeout.
